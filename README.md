### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
**I'm Cristiano Fromagio â€” a full-stack web developer from Brazil.**

I am passionate about accessibility, open knowledge, optimization and debugging things to see how they work (and most of the times why they don't). My favorite stack these days is <img height="16" width="16" src="./icons/laravel.svg"/> Laravel and <img height="16" width="16" src="./icons/angular.svg"/> Angular, but I'm also exploring <img height="16" width="16" src="./icons/react.svg"/> React on the side.

When I'm not on coding mode, I enjoy running in the afternoon, look for underwater scenes in unexpected places and learning terms or concepts that reflect a collective knowledge like eponymous laws/adages (Brooks's law, Parkinson's law, Hick's law, Murphy's law), terms for a specific behavior/situation (Sword of Damocles, Streisand Effect, Peter Principle, Cognitive Dissonance, Founder's Syndrome) and code words of similar kind.

I'm also right-eye blind (Coats' Disease) which means 3D movies are boring and some handshakes may go unnoticed.
